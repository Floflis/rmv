"Let's help me build the "rmv" tool.

This command should check if the "trash" command is installed and, if not, will run sudo apt install for it.

Then, when user run something like "rmv file.txt", it will move such file to the recycle bin using "trash"."

Sure! Here's a possible implementation for the "rmv" tool:
#!/bin/bash

# Check if trash-cli is installed, and install it if necessary
if ! command -v trash &> /dev/null
then
    echo "trash-cli is not installed. Installing it now..."
    sudo apt install trash-cli
fi

# Move the specified file(s) to the recycle bin using trash-cli
trash "$@"

This script checks if the trash command is available by using the command built-in, and installs it using sudo apt install if it's not found. Then it simply calls trash with any arguments passed to the script, which moves the specified files to the recycle bin.

To use the script, you can save it to a file (e.g. rmv) and make it executable with chmod +x rmv. Then you can use it like this:
# move a single file to the recycle bin
./rmv file.txt

# move multiple files to the recycle bin
./rmv file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

This should provide a safer alternative to the rm command, since it moves files to the recycle bin instead of deleting them permanently.

"Awesome! Fantastic!

You've even guessed I would love to have the "rmv" program written in Bash rather than Python/others!"

I'm glad I could help! Bash is a great choice for this type of utility, as it is a common shell language and is available on most Unix-like systems. Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
