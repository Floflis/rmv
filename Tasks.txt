- "rm" wrapper

Options: default sends to "rmv" folder at recycle bin, and safer/safu sends to the recycle bin without being encased into a folder. The purpose of the default option is to clear the clutter when a lot of background tasks are using "rmv" without direct user input.

Works as a replacing wrapper for rm
